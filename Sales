#In this SQL, I'm querying a database titled BIT_DB_sara with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB_sara.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB_sara.JanSales  
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all of the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB_sara.customers customers
INNERJOIN BIT_DB_sara.FebSales febsales
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB_sara.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB_sara.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB_sara.FebSales
AND location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101" 
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB_sara.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB_sara.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Quantity > 2;
