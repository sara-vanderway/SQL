# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB_sara.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB_sara.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB_sara.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB_sara.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#What is the average danceability for the top 10 most popular songs?
WITH popularity_table AS (
  SELECT
  spotifydata.track_name, spotifydata.popularity, danceability
  FROM Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10
)
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM popularity_table;

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table using a CTE.
#Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity,
WITH popularity_table AS (
  SELECT
  spotifydata.artist_name, AVG(spotifydata.popularity) AS avg_popularity
  FROM Spotifydata
  GROUP BY Spotifydata.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag 
FROM popularity_table
WHERE avg_popularity >=90;
